# Spark

Spark is a lightweight, responsive, front-end web design framework with multiple colors and styles.

## Styles</h2>
The framework comes prebuilt with several color themes that are interchangeable, in both shiny and flat styles.
Currently, the base colors are __silver__ (default), __blue__, __green__, __orange__, __red__, __purple__, __lime__ and __dragonfruit__.

## Nonintrusive
Spark is what we like to call nonintrusive. When you include the css/js files in the head of your HTML file, by default with no extra classes it styles only the bare necessities like font families/weights/sizes/colors, resets etc. While it may require slightly more markup than other frameworks to use theme elements, it's much easier to customize elements with the default all-in Spark rather than having to call big long selector lists to override. And that's why we started it.

## Simplicity
The whole basis of Spark is to keep things simple. Simple to use and simple to customize. We've got plans to make it even simpler but let's take things one step at a time.

## The Project
The project lives here and at <http://www.codewithspark.com> where you can find detailed documentation on how to use it.

## Versioning
Spark is versioned using <a href="http://semver.org">Semantic Versioning</a>.

## Getting Started
Download the latest release from <http://www.codewithspark.com>. Inside the zip archive file you'll find the following directories/files:

- __css/__ contains both the development and minified Spark CSS files
- __js/__ contains both the development and minified Spark JS files as well as html5shiv.js (HTML5 support in IE8)
- __font/__ contains the excellent FontAwesome webfont (included in Spark)
- __less/__ the LESS files for building Spark using the LESS compiler (Spark LESS files, FontAwesome LESS files and a handy vendors LESS file with functions for adding vendor prefixes to CSS3 properties in __less/classes__)
- __templates/__ some simple templates to get you started with Spark
- __LICENSE__ is Spark's license file, under the MIT license
- __README.md__ is this file.


## Planned
Currently planned is to use the custom.less file to allow you to create your own colors for the themes. A page on the website will allow you to enter colors and automatically generate LESS for you to paste into your custom.less file, allowing you to use your own theme colors almost instantly.
